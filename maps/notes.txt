/* Maps:
    * all keys must be the same type
		* all values must be the same type.
		* can be iterated over
		* don't need to know all keys at compile time.
		* passes by reference!
	Structs:
	  * Values can be different type
		* Keys don't support indexing (and therefore no iterating)
		* You need to know all fields at compile time
		* passes by value! (to pass by reference, use the pointer)
